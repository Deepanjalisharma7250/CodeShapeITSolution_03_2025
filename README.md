# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection - Frontend Website

#deply link:- https://creditcardfrauddetection-sentinel.netlify.app/

A fully frontend-based simulation project that educates users on how modern fraud detection systems work using behavioral analysis, machine learning visualization, and rule-based tracking. This project includes an interactive, animated landing page and showcases essential security features through a UI-based approach—no backend required.

## 🚀 Live Experience Flow

- 🎬 **Landing Page**:  
  Includes two images (user-uploaded) introducing the project visually. Auto-transitions after **10 seconds** to the main dashboard.

- 🧭 **Main Interface**:  
  A dashboard simulating real-time fraud detection operations through UI interactions, mock data, and animations.

## 🛡️ Key Features (Fully Implemented - Frontend Only)

1. **Transaction Monitoring**  
   - Real-time mock data stream of purchases  
   - Anomaly visualization (e.g., sudden spikes, flagged in red)

2. **Behavioral Analysis**  
   - Simulated user profiles with "usual behavior" vs. suspicious deviations  
   - UI shows alerts for unusual behavior patterns (e.g., time, amount, frequency)

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   - Interactive demo of OTP popup, biometrics animation, and security Q&A

4. **Geolocation & Device Tracking**  
   - Device + location match visualization with map pins  
   - Flags new device logins with warnings (simulated)

5. **Machine Learning Simulation**  
   - Fraud prediction result using sample models (frontend mock, no backend)  
   - Visual graphs showing ML outputs (e.g., decision tree flow, risk score)

6. **Rule-Based Detection**  
   - Static rules like "3 transactions in under 5 minutes" or "purchase > $10,000"  
   - Triggered alerts shown on screen with rule details
